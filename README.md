Comments: Using a slip day for additional testing.  Though the PDF mentioned that the scrollViewText is the only view item in the Scroll View, I've included the image in it as well for a better experience in my personal opinion as mentioned in this post: https://edstem.org/us/courses/52967/discussion/4648877
